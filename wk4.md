### Project Oops Slackers Week 4
This week the group has continued to meet through signal and in person as the deployment date gets closer. 
I worked to get an iso of Windows 7 off of a virtual machine at the school because in the virtual machine there were no admin restrictions to do so.
This can go onto our server if a better suited iso cannot be found in time.

### Backup Plan
I also have begun and should finish by this upcoming class a Ubuntu server through my Raspberry Pi. 
Through that server I will add Clonezilla to make it a Clonezilla server.
This can be used with the iPXE work being done to clone Windows 7 to the computers that we are targeting for installation.
Both of these thing are being done as backup preparations for our upcoming install.
Though I donâ€™t anticipate that these will be needed we concluded that it would be nice to have backup options and will be a good learning experience. 
I am using the following link as guidance.
